          <h2>Why appoint the City Clerk?</h2>
              <p>The California Government Code requires each city to have a City Clerk who is to be either elected or appointed. The City of La Mesa’s City Clerk has been an elected position since the City was incorporated in 1912. To run for the office of City Clerk a candidate must be at least 18 years of age, a registered voter and reside in the City of La Mesa. Other than these minimum requirements, the City cannot impose any additional qualification requirements for the position such as level of experience, education, professional certifications or training. In addition, the residency requirement cannot be waived pursuant to Government Code Section 36502(a).</p>

              <p>As cities have grown and government has become more complex, the duties of the City Clerk have become more numerous and technical in nature and now require professional skills and expertise in areas such as federal and state laws (e.g. election law, records management and conflict of interest regulations). According to the League of California Cities, of the 482 cities in California, about 28 percent of Clerks are elected and 72 percent are appointed. This trend emphasizes that cities are recognizing the need for professionally and technically trained certified City Clerks.</p>

              <p>The duties of the City’s current City Clerk are to:</p>

              <ul>
              <li>maintain and protect all vital, permanent and historic records of the City;</li>
              <li>provide access to those records for research purposes;</li>
              <li>administer the citywide records management and document imaging programs;</li>
              <li>prepare agendas and support material in an electronic format for City Council, La Mesa Public Financing Authority and Successor Agency meetings;</li>
              <li>record and preserve the actions of the City Council, La Mesa Public Financing Authority and Successor Agency;</li>
              <li>issue resolutions, and prepare ordinances for publication and codification;</li>
              <li>update and maintain the Municipal Code;</li>
              <li>administer all municipal elections;</li>
              <li>serve as the filing officer for all campaign and conflict of interest disclosure statements as required by the Political Reform Act;</li>
              <li>coordinate ethics training as required by the California Government Code;</li>
              <li>administer oaths of office;</li>
              <li>prepare, publish, post and mail all public notices;</li>
              <li>receive appeals and subpoenas;</li>
              <li>coordinate the recruitments for board, commission and committee appointments;</li>
              <li>maintain and post the appointive list for board, commission and committee members and other administrative duties as required by the Maddy Act;</li>
              <li>process and issue special event permits;</li>
              <li>provide staff support to the Human Relations Advisory Commission;</li>
              <li>prepare proclamations and commendations; and</li>
              <li>perform routine administrative duties and other assignments as required.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>There is no certainty that an elected City Clerk will possess such skills and expertise. However, an appointed City Clerk is selected based on certain educational qualifications, management experience, knowledge of, and ability to carry out the duties of the office (please see the example of the minimum qualifications at the link to the right). An appointed City Clerk would be subject to standard personnel procedures, including annual performance evaluations and possible termination for unsatisfactory performance, and be held accountable to perform to the same performance levels established for the members of the City Manager’s executive staff. Poor performance by an elected City Clerk can only be addressed through a recall process.</p>

              <p>Over the years the City of La Mesa has been fortunate to have a series of City Clerks, all of whom lived in the City, had local government experience and were willing to run for office. This may not always be the case. Future elected City Clerks may not possess the requisite skills or have the ability to perform the duties required of the position. </p>

              <p>Currently, the City Clerk performs the full range of administrative duties and legal responsibilities required of the position and holds the professional designation of Certified Municipal Clerk.</p>

              <p>One would expect the duties of this vital position to be performed by an experienced and skilled professional. This can best be accomplished by selecting a person to serve based on professional skill, education and relevant experience, not by simply running a successful campaign.</p>

              <p><strong>La Mesa deserves the best. Vote YES on measure M.</strong></p>
